      <description>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination node.1

      <title>Open Source Tools to Get Started With Verilog Simulation</title>

      <description>In this post, I shall be demonstrating how to use open-source tools that include icarus verilog which is used for compiling verilog code and, gtk wave for observing timing diagrams.
Icarus verilog is a open-source verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It operates as a compiler, compiling source code written in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into some target format. For batch simulation, the compiler can generate an intermediate form called vvp assembly. This intermediate form is executed by the vvp command.</description>
