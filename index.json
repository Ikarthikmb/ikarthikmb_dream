It operates as a compiler, compiling source code written in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into some target format. For batch simulation, the compiler can generate an intermediate form called vvp assembly. This intermediate form is executed by the vvp command.","tags":["verilog","inverter","iverilog","gtkwave"],"title":"Open Source Tools to Get Started With Verilog Simulation","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/posts/iverilog_guide/"},{"categories":["raspberry pi"],"description":"The set up for Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi is the same as the previous article on how to Set Up Raspberry Pi 4 through laptop/pc using Ethernet cable(No Moniter, No Wi-Fi) with some minor changes which we are going to see.\nHardware Requirements:  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (1/2/4 GB RAM) USB Type-C power supply Personal computer  Steps to install the required software tools  If you had followed the previous article then skip these steps and move to \u0026lsquo;step-6\u0026rsquo;.","tags":["raspberry pi","wifi","howto"],"title":"Set up Raspberry Pi 4(Wi-Fi)","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/rpi4_setup_wifi/"},{"categories":["raspberry pi"],"description":"In this we shall be working with Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B of 1Gb RAM for the set up. Raspberry-Pi is a single board computer used for educational purposes and DIY projects with an affordable cost, requires a power supply of 5 volts with 3 amps current.\nOperating Systems like Raspbian OS, Windows, Linux, RISC OS, can be installed into it. The Pi 4 model has Ethernet, wireless adapter, USB type-C port, and 40 GPIO(General Purpose Input Output) pins.","tags":["raspberry pi","ethernet","howto"],"title":"Set Up Raspberry Pi 4 through laptop/pc using Ethernet cable(No Monitor, No Wi-Fi)","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/rpi4_setup_w_ethernet/"}]
