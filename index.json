It operates as a compiler, compiling source code written in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into some target format. For batch simulation, the compiler can generate an intermediate form called vvp assembly. This intermediate form is executed by the vvp command.","tags":["verilog","inverter","iverilog","gtkwave"],"title":"Open Source Tools to Get Started With Verilog Simulation","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/posts/iverilog_guide/"},{"categories":["walpaper"],"description":"","tags":["electronics","wallpaper","raspberry pi"],"title":"Raspberry Pi 4 with Heatsink","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/wallpaper/rpired_wall/"},{"categories":["mindmaps"],"description":"A mind-map for transport carriers in semiconductors.","tags":["electronics","semiconductors"],"title":"Carrier Transport in Semiconductors","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/wallpaper/carriertransport_map/"},{"categories":["math"],"description":"","tags":["math","note","mindmaps"],"title":"Fourier Transform Note","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/wallpaper/fouriertransform_note/"},{"categories":["walpaper"],"description":"","tags":["electronics","wallpaper"],"title":"Top Shot of a Webcam Lens","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/wallpaper/cam_inside_wall/"},{"categories":["meme"],"description":"meme","tags":["meme","latex"],"title":"Mathematician at an interview","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/wallpaper/latex_meme/"},{"categories":["walpaper"],"description":"","tags":["electronics","wallpaper"],"title":"Inside of an 1TB Harddrive","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/wallpaper/harddrive_open/"},{"categories":["raspberry pi"],"description":"The set up for Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi is the same as the previous article on how to Set Up Raspberry Pi 4 through laptop/pc using Ethernet cable(No Moniter, No Wi-Fi) with some minor changes which we are going to see.\nHardware Requirements:  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (1/2/4 GB RAM) USB Type-C power supply Personal computer  Steps to install the required software tools  If you had followed the previous article then skip these steps and move to \u0026lsquo;step-6\u0026rsquo;.","tags":["raspberry pi","wifi","howto"],"title":"Set up Raspberry Pi 4(Wi-Fi)","url":"https://ikarthikmb.github.io/posts/rpi4_setup_wifi/"},{"categories":["raspberry pi"],"description":"In this we shall be working with Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B of 1Gb RAM for the set up.
